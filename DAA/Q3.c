/*
Given an already shorted array of +ve integers design an algo to & implement using program to
find the key element from an array arr[n] search at the indices arr[0],arr[2],arr[4]....arr[2^k] and so on
once interval arr[2^k]<key<arr[2^k+1] is found perform lenier search from index k to k+1 to find the key. (Complexity < O(n))
